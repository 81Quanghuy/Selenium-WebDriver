We always appreciated contributions that add more examples to this repository. Ensure to pay attention to the following things:

- keep it simple: a plain JavaScript file should cover the use case
- test it: all examples should be tested in CI to ensure they don't break
- document it: ensure there is a `README.md` that contains how to run the example
